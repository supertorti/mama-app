    # This RewriteRule is used to dynamically discover the RewriteBase path.
    # See https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule
    # Here we will compare the stripped per-dir path *relative to the filesystem
    # path where the .htaccess file is read from* with the URI of the request.
    #
    # If a match is found, the prefix path is stored into an ENV var that is later
    # used to properly prefix the URI of the front controller index.php.
    # This is what makes it possible to host a Symfony application under a subpath,
    # such as example.com/subpath

    # The convoluted rewrite condition means:
    #   1. Matches the entire URI in the RewriteRule and backreference it using $0
    #   2. Strips the request uri the per-directory path and use it as REQUEST_URI.
    #      This is documented in https://bit.ly/3zDm3SI ("What is matched?")
    #   3. Evaluates the RewriteCond. Assuming that your DocumentRoot is /var/www/html,
    #      that this .htaccess is in the /var/www/html/public directory and your request URI
    #      is /public/hello/world, the following happens:
    #
    #      * strips per-dir prefix: /var/www/html/public/hello/world -> hello/world
    #      * matches the pattern '.*'  with the string 'hello/world' (the second capture group in the PCRE pattern)
    #      * matches the pattern '/.+/ with the string '/public'     (the first capture group in the PCRE pattern)
    #      * RewriteCond: input='/public/hello/world::hello/world' pattern='^(/.+)/(.*)::\\2$' => matched
    #
    #   4. Execute the RewriteRule:
    #      * The %1 in the RewriteRule flag E=BASE:%1 refers to the first capture group captured in the RewriteCond ^(/.+)/(.*)
    #      * sets the ENV variable BASE to '/public'
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}::$0 ^(/.+)/(.*)::\2$
    RewriteRule .* - [E=BASE:%1]

    # Sets the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header removed by Apache
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .+
    RewriteRule ^ - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%0]

    # Removes the /index.php/ part from a URL, if present
    RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} =""
    RewriteRule ^index\.php(?:/(.*)|$) %{ENV:BASE}/$1 [R=301,L]

    # Route /api/* requests to Symfony front controller
    RewriteRule ^api(/|$) %{ENV:BASE}/index.php [L]

    # Serve existing files directly (CSS, JS, images, etc.)
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
    RewriteRule ^ - [L]
